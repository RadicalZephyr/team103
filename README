Basic Class structure:

RobotPlayer is the interface that the battlecode framework uses.
Every time a new robot is created, it gets its own instance of
RobotPlayer, the constructor is called, and then the run method is
called.

If control ever reaches the end of the run method that robot is
destroyed.  This is why we have a while (true) loop at the end of the
run method as a catch all.

All actual functionality of the robot is contained in the
RobotController class that is passed to the RobotPlayer's constructor,
thus the RC is what actually needs to be passed around.

The basic control structure is that the RobotPlayer acts like a
dispatcher.  It owns an instance of the StateMachine class, which is
the dispatcher for handling the grunt work of swapping to different
states.

The StateMachine in turn has a pointer to an instance of an Actor
class, or one of its descendants.  The purpose of the actor class is
to provide a higher level view of the functionality prevented in the
RobotController class.  One of the reasons for this is to tailor the
high-level abilities provided to the actual hardware that is present
in the robots.

In addition, every State that gets instantiated contains a pointer to
the controlling StateMachine and the Actor class.  This has several
implications: first, it allows the State to do ANYTHING.  It can
change what the Actor class is, it can initiate state changes.
Second, yeah... anything.

Right now, there's a single catch-all state InConstruction that is the
first one entered by every robot.  New robots should default to
turning off so that the building robot can finish building them before
the try to do calculations.  Since when every robot is created it
should only have one component (the motor), that's the test we use.
In addition, as a sanity check, we don't turnOff if this robot has
been turned off before.
